## Quick and dirty git guide

#### Add to a repo that already exists

I'm going to assume that you're 

1.	Clone the repo
	*	Navigate to where you want to want the repo to live on your computer using the command line
		Mac/Unix guide [here.](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-(-basics-))
	*	`git clone <<https git address> <<new folder name that will hold the repo on your comp>>`
2.	Add/make a folder, and add your code. => `git add` ("Gather items to ship")
3.	"Box the items you want to ship" => `git commit`
4.	"Ship the package" => `git push`
